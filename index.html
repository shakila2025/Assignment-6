                    <p class="text-succes">  Afghanistan, a country long associated with conflict and political instability, is standing at the cusp of a digital revolution. Despite facing numerous challenges, there's a growing recognition that technology and innovation could be key drivers in reimagining and rebuilding the nation's future.

                        Technological Landscape in Afghanistan:
                        
                        Historically, Afghanistan's technological infrastructure has lagged due to ongoing conflicts. However, recent years have seen a significant shift. As of 2023, the Afghanistan Telecom Regulatory Authority (ATRA) reports over 8 million internet users, a remarkable increase from just a few years prior. Mobile phone penetration has reached 90% in urban areas, though rural regions still face connectivity challenges.
                        
                        The Rise of Tech Startups:
                        
                        Afghanistan is witnessing a burgeoning startup ecosystem. Young entrepreneurs, often educated abroad, are returning with skills and a vision to foster change. Kabul, the capital city, is home to a growing number of tech startups focusing on everything from e-commerce to digital education platforms. These startups are not only creating jobs but are also offering solutions tailored to local needs.
                        
                        Focus on Education and Digital Literacy:
                        
                        A key aspect of Afghanistan's tech revolution is the emphasis on education and digital literacy. Initiatives like Code to Inspire, the first coding school for girls in Afghanistan, are breaking barriers. Moreover, universities are increasingly incorporating IT and digital skills into their curricula, aiming to equip the younger generation with the tools needed for a digital economy.
                        
                        Challenges and Opportunities:
                        
                        Afghanistan's journey from battlefield to cyberspace is laden with challenges. Limited infrastructure, a lack of skilled IT professionals, and security concerns are significant hurdles. However, these challenges also present opportunities for innovation. For instance, solar-powered internet solutions are being explored to overcome electricity shortages.
                        
                        Government and International Support:
                        
                        The Afghan government, realizing the potential of technology, has been working on policies to promote IT and innovation. International aid and partnerships are also playing a crucial role, with organizations like USAID and the World Bank funding various tech initiatives.</p>

                          <p class="card-text"> Grapes are a significant horticultural crop in Afghanistan, grown for both fresh consumption and raisin production, with major cultivation areas in provinces like Kandahar, Kapisa, Herat, Ghazni, Kabul, and Parwan. Several varieties of grapes are cultivated, including those for fresh eating (like Hussaini, Taifi, and Red Kandahari) and those for raisins (like Shondakhanai and Keshmeshi). Afghan grapes are known for their quality and are sold both locally and exported.Grapes are an attractive horticultural crop in Afghanistan owing to their high productiveness and commercial value, which is in turn due to the large and wide-spread area of production in the country. The cultivation of this fruit is concentrated in the provinces of Kandahar, Kapisa, Herat, Ghazni, Kabul, and Parwan. Afghan grapes are grown for both fresh consumption and production of raisins.

                            Among the grapevine varieties cultivated for fresh grapes are hussaini, taifi, kasendra, lal, kata, gholafan, red kandahari, and red and green raucha, while the most common varieties grown for raisin production include shondakhanai, keshmeshi, black keshmeshi, lal, and mehr amaldi.
                            
                            Most of the grape varieties grown in this country belong to the Vitis vinifera or the common grape vine species, and they are typically harvested from July through October. Afghan grapes and raisins are sold to local and neighboring markets, but they are also exported to overseas countries. </p>

                                  <p class="card-text">Afghan women have suffered considerably in the past several decades. The continuous conflict in the country, poor perceptions and local norms, misinterpretation of the Islamic teachings to the uneducated communities and its imposition on the people of the country are believed to be the major causes behind the rollback in maintaining the women rights. SADA as a humanitarian organization and women rights defender has been regularly trying to contribute its part in reducing the distresses of marginalized women in Afghanistan.  In this regard the organization has implemented various advocacy projects. Some of the works done are as follow:
                                    Community lead campaigns in 60 villages in Dand, Damna, and Kandahar city, the purpose of the project was to change the perception of the local influencers regarding the women rights by teaching them the real Islamic knowledges.
                                    Providing capacity building trainings for 90 young female teachers in Kandahar province in Dand, Daman and Kandahar city. The teachers were capacitated about the basic and advanced teaching skills and techniques.
                                    Provided vocational trainings for women in 38 villages in Chora and TarinKot districts of Ruzgan province. Through this program around 129 females were capacitated on embroidery skills.
                                    SADA is committed to advocate and campaign for women rights in Afghanistan in line with the principles of Islam, International Human Rights and the positive culture of the country. The organization is taking efforts to alleviate all kind of violence against women so that they can become equal citizens of the country. Therefore, the organization is interested to partner with UN, partner organization and other women rights defenders and donors for the implementation of programs that practically support women and allow them feel safe, equal and counted.
