<h4><b>ADVOCACY OF GIRLS’ EDUCATION</b></h4>
<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<p>Afghanistan has progressed significantly in the sector of education during the years 2021 &#8211; 2021. According to the Ministry of Education of the Islamic republic of Afghanistan and UNICEF- post August 2021 “the students enrollment increased from 900,000 in 2001 to 9.5 million enrolled in 2021”, while thousands of schools are established and constructed across the country, thousands of teachers (male and female) are capacitated with teaching skills and schooling standards are upgraded. However, the data also shows that even “before 15th August 2021, 4.2 million children were not enrolled in schools, out of which 60% are girls”, and only 19% of the female below 15 years are literate, just 16% of all schools in the country are girls’ schools. The primary education, female teachers were reported 36.157% in 2019, while for the secondary education, female teachers were reported just 35.63 %.<br>In response to the mentioned statistics around girl students and female teachers, SADA has constantly been advocating for the improvement of girls’ enrollment ratios in schools. In this regard, SADA advocacy teams conducted several campaigns, awareness-sessions and trainings of community elders, religious scholars and parents on village (s), district (s) and provincial levels.<br>On 17th September 2021, the government announced the re-opening of the secondary schools after being-closed for months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the government asked the secondary school girls to stay at home.<br>On 21 March 2022, the MoE publicly confirmed that 0n 23rd March 2022 schools will start for all children at all levels including girls. However, the last-minute U-turn by the authorities seriously disappointed the girls, families and the people of Afghanistan as the MoE extended the ban on girls’ secondary education until further notice. This ban directly affects 1.1 million secondary schools’ girls.<br>At this critical situation, SADA as girls’ education activist remain solid and will continue advocating for the re-opening of girls’ secondary schools. SADA will also keep promoting the expansion of girls’ education until every girl of this country have access to quality, safe and free education. Furthermore, SADA will continue advocating for the recruitment of maximum number of female teachers in public schools and educational institutes across the country.<br>For SADA’s ongoing advocacy programs, please kindly refer to the updated factsheet.</p>

<h5><b>AGRICULTURE &amp; IRRIGATION</b></h5>
<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<p>The man-made tragedy combined by the natural disasters like; earthquakes, floods, and droughts heavily affected the Afghan people, their livelihood, infrastructure and socio-economic structure, the negative impacts of which are particularly felt in the rural Afghanistan where more than 70% of the population lives, and agriculture is the main source of their income. <br>Food security depends on agriculture, which further relies on sufficient water, functioning irrigation system, adequate rainfall and a fertile soil. SADA therefore gives special attention for upgrading the agriculture &amp; irrigation in the country.</p>
<p>During the past three decades SADA has successfully implemented numerous agriculture and irrigation projects in Zabul, Uruzgan, Kandahar and Helmand provinces. The projects included; the establishment of the fruit-trees nurseries and orchard development, construction of water-wells, distribution of improved seeds and fertilizer agriculture program, rehabilitation of traditional Karezes and canals, construction and restoration of NAWARS, the livelihood improvement projects, the plantation of hundred-thousand fruits and non-fruits trees. Furthermore, SADA has trained thousands of farmers and small agri-businesses owners on improved and modern agriculture and irrigation techniques and market development strategies. <br>SADAs’ partners and donors in the agriculture and irrigation sector includes; the Royal Netherland Embassy, ZAO Refugee Care, UNFAO, DFID, Afghan government and PRT Kandahar.</p>
<p>Currently, SADA has a separate department of agriculture and irrigation, which is run by a qualified and vastly-experienced team. SADA is highly interested in exploring new partnerships in this sector. For SADAs’ agriculture and irrigation projects and programs, please kindly refer to the updated factsheet.</p>

<h5>&nbsp;<b>Water Hygiene and sanitation (WASH)</b></h5>
<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<p>An improved Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) system is a fundamental need for any healthy family and society. On this regard SADA’s objective is to ensure an increased access to sustainable, safe and improved Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities for all needy communities in Afghanistan. &nbsp;Since its establishment, SADA has implemented several WASH projects in the country.</p>
<p>Some examples of WASH projects implemented by SADA are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improving basic services and capacity building in three districts in Ruzgan province.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Construction of new water wells, repairing of the existing water-pumps in Kandahar and Ruzgan provinces.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Construction of latrines in in Mainwand and Zerai districts of Kandahar province.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Establishing and training of water committees in Ruzgan province.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Construction of 81 new water wells in Ruzgan province.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Conducting hundreds of community awareness sessions about WASH and the usage of clean drinking waters.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Promoting the hygiene and sanitation behavioural change in 145 villages in Ruzgan and Kandahar provinces.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, SADA has a highly educated and experienced WASH team and is committed to continue working in this crucial sector.</p>

SADA has 26 years experience implementing the infrastructure development projects and programs in several provinces. Most of the work has been done in sheltering for internally displaced people, distribution of solar panels, construction of gabion system, construction of canals, rehabilitation of water storages and reservoirs, restoration of Karez systems for potable water and construction of culverts and water wells.</p>
<p>Some of the implemented projects in infrastructure development are as bellow:</p>
<p>&#8211; Equal Financial Ceiling Project, worth USD 1.4 million funded by Royal Netherland Embassy. A community development project which included the construction of shelter houses, rehabilitation of water wells and installation of hand pumps.<br>&#8211; Construction of high schools in four districts in Kandahar province, which included Dund district funded by MRRD, Shah WaliKot district funded by IOM, Shorawak district funded by DFID &amp; DOUCH and SpinBoldak district by UNOPS.

<h5><b>FOOD SECURITY, NUTRITION &amp; HEALTH</b></h5>
<p>SADA has been endeavouring to alleviate poverty and protect the dignity of the Afghan people. One of SADA’s key areas of intervention is to ensure poor, ultra-poor and vulnerable people improve their nutrition and food security through the implementation of livelihood, food and health projects. Therefore, SADA’s work is focused to enable small scale farmers’ businesses, kitchen gardening, food-for-work projects, and technical trainings, so beneficiaries are able to increase their productivity of agriculture and access markets in order to ensure food security of their families.<br>SADA is particularly focused on the role of women, farmers, youth, IDPs, returnees, child and female headed families and mothers. We implement Food Security, Nutrition &amp; Health projects with the aim to enable woman, man and child lead a healthy, fulfilling life of self-reliance and dignity. <br>SADA’s past experience in the sector (around 30 projects) with UNWFP were mostly in the areas of food security.</p>
<p>Important Note:<br>Acknowledging the current crisis in the country in terms of health and food security, and in order to reach out to the poor and needy families, SADA Board of Director has decided to include Health as a new working component to the core areas of interventions. In this regard SADA has also developed and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH). Nevertheless, SADA already has sufficient experience in this field, as health and nutrition were embedded in most of SADA’s projects.</p>
<p>Most recently, SADA brought on-board a number of qualified medical doctors to its Core Leadership Team (CLT) for leading the Food-security, Nutrition, and Health department of the organization. The team has already developed good coordination with the MoPH and partner organizations. SADA is trying to explore and establish partnerships with donors with the aim to improve health for all citizens, particularly women, children and the most vulnerable through the delivery of quality and financially sustainable health services for underserved populations. <br>SADA is taking efforts to prove as one of the active health cluster members to save lives and promote dignity in humanitarian and public health emergencies. To support Afghanistan Health Cluster in achieving its goals and targets, SADA will contribute in delivering health care services to the affected population living in the hard-to-reach or white areas, especially in the province where SADA has operational presence (Kabul, Zabul, Urozgan, Kandahar, Samangan, Balkh, Faryab, and Sar-e-Pul). SADA also has the capacity to train healthcare workers and build their capacity in responding to the disease outbreaks including case management and Infection Prevention and Control. In addition, SADA will extend its support in public awareness and social mobilization interventions where needed.</p>

<h5><b>CHILD PROTECTION</b></h5>
<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<p>SADA has the vision of “To alleviate poverty and human sufferings to see educated, self-reliant, peaceful and developed Afghanistan”. We will be unable to reach to this vision unless we pay thoughtful attention to child protection from any kind of abuse.

<h5><b>WOMEN RIGHTS</b></h5>
<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<p>Afghan women have suffered considerably in the past several decades. The continuous conflict in the country, poor perceptions and local norms, misinterpretation of the Islamic teachings to the uneducated communities and its imposition on the people of the country are believed to be the major causes behind the rollback in maintaining the women rights.</p>
<p>SADA as a humanitarian organization and women rights defender has been regularly trying to contribute its part in reducing the distresses of marginalized women in Afghanistan. In this regard the organization has implemented various advocacy projects. Some of the works done are as follow:</p>
<p>&#8211; Community lead campaigns in 60 villages in Dand, Damna, and Kandahar city, the purpose of the project was to change the perception of the local influencers regarding the women rights by teaching them the real Islamic knowledges. <br>&#8211; Providing capacity building trainings for 90 young female teachers in Kandahar province in Dand, Daman and Kandahar city. The teachers were capacitated about the basic and advanced teaching skills and techniques. <br>&#8211; Provided vocational trainings for women in 38 villages in Chora and TarinKot districts of Ruzgan province. Through this program around 129 females were capacitated on embroidery skills.</p>
<p>SADA is committed to advocate and campaign for women rights in Afghanistan in line with the principles of Islam, International Human Rights and the positive culture of the country. The organization is taking efforts to alleviate all kind of violence against women so that they can become equal citizens of the country. Therefore, the organization is interested to partner with UN, partner organization and other women rights defenders and donors for the implementation of programs that practically support women and allow them feel safe, equal and counted.</p>

Recognizing the unique challenges faced in these regions, SADA has tailored its approach to address the specific health needs of the population. The project includes fortified healthcare facilities, trained health workers, and educational initiatives focused on maternal and child health, infectious disease prevention, and general health awareness.<br>In Zabul, SADA has established partnerships with local health authorities to strengthen the healthcare infrastructure, ensuring that essential services are available to those in need. Through the recruitment and training of local health personnel, the project aims to build sustainable health systems that empower communities to take charge of their health. Moreover, awareness campaigns have been launched to educate the community on nutrition, hygiene, and preventive health measures, fostering a culture of health consciousness and proactive health management.<br>Kandahar and Urozgan have also benefited significantly from SADA&#8217;s health initiatives, with a focus on mobile health clinics that reach remote and underserved areas. These clinics provide essential medical services, vaccinations, and health education directly to those who may not have access to fixed health facilities. By implementing culturally sensitive programs and engaging community leaders, SADA has not only improved healthcare delivery but has also fostered trust and collaboration within the communities, leading to positive health behaviors and outcomes. This holistic approach demonstrates SADA’s commitment to building a healthier future for the people of Zabul, Kandahar, and Urozgan.</div>

Skill Development:</b> Participants in community kitchens can learn valuable cooking skills, food safety practices, and nutrition education, empowering them to prepare healthy meals for themselves and their families.<br><b>4. Economic Opportunities:</b> Community kitchens may provide training and employment opportunities for local residents, enabling them to gain skills in the culinary arts or food service industry.<br><b>5. Support for Local Producers:</b> Many community kitchens prioritize sourcing ingredients from local farmers and suppliers, boosting the local economy and promoting sustainable food practices.<br><b>6. Cultural Exchange:</b> These kitchens often celebrate diverse culinary traditions, allowing community members to share recipes, techniques, and cultural dishes, fostering understanding and appreciation among different groups.<br><b>7. Health Improvement: </b>By providing healthy meal options, community kitchens can contribute to improved overall health and well-being among participants, which may lead to reduced healthcare costs in the long run.<br><b>8.
